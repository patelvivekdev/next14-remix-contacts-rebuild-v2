## Using bun

First, force install the dependencies to make the React 19 Beta work:

```bash
bun i
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
